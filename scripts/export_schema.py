"""Export JSON Schema from the Pydantic interchange models.

Regenerates the schema/*.json files checked into this repo from the models
in src/models/. Run after any change to a model that affects the wire
schema (new/renamed/removed field, changed type, etc.):

The output is the interchange contract published for robust-rail-solver
